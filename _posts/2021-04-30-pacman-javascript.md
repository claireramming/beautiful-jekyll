title: Pacman Game with Javascript
subtitle: Skills used -> javascript, html, css
---

When I was a kid I was obsessed with a little joystick box I could plug in to my cathode ray tube tv and play a bunch of old arcade games like Pacman. 
As part of the Scrimba front end developer path, I was excited to learn how to code pacman in javascript! After already building a snake game with Ania 
in a previous module, I stopped the lessons fairly early once she had the basic styling set up and tried to code it myself without guidance. 
I successfully made pacman move around the board within the limitations of the walls, and eat pellets to score points. Most of the rest of the lesson I
followed along, attempting my own spin on different facets of the game to make it act more like the original pacman game. After the course I decided to give
it a lot more styling and functionality to make it more pleasing to play. I'm happy with my progress so far and hope to keep improving the game.

Play my pacman game [here](https://claireramming.github.io/pacman/)!

See my code on [github](https://github.com/claireramming/pacman).

### Current functionality past Ania's course:
- pacman moves on it's own until it hits a wall
- extra styling
- pacman 'eats' and changes visually direction
- cherry placed randomly in empty square after certain point

### known bugs:
- pacman does not always eat ghost when it should

### upcoming functionality
- support for multiple levels
- new board display
- logic for ghosts to chase pacman and "run from" pacman if scared
- option to restart game without reloading
- will visually show a win or loss (other than game functions stopping)
